# Pandas_Data-Analysis


## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use **Pandas** for data analysis, including reading CSV files and performing **scale analysis** on sales data.



## Key Features
- **Reading & Cleaning Data**: Handling missing values and filtering records for accuracy.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Understanding dataset properties and distributions.
- **Data Scaling**: Normalizing numerical columns to enhance comparisons.
- **Visualization (Optional)**: Presenting data through charts and graphs for better interpretation.
 -Here are some data analysis tasks you can perform on your dataset:

    Basic Statistics
        Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of marks and attendance.
        Find the highest and lowest marks.

    Filtering and Sorting
        Retrieve students who scored more than 80 marks.
        List students with attendance below 60%.
        Sort the dataset by marks in descending order.

    Grouping and Aggregation
        Count the number of students in each performance category.
        Find the average mark per city.

    Visualization Tasks (Using Matplotlib/Seaborn)
        Create a histogram of marks.
        Generate a bar chart showing average marks per city.
        Plot a scatter plot between age and marks to analyze trends.
         Visualization Tasks (Better Insights)
         Box plot of marks to analyze outliers.
        Heatmap to show correlation between marks, attendance, and age.
        Pie chart to show the percentage of students in different performance categories.
        Line graph to show the trend of average marks across different age groups.

    Advanced Queries
        Find the top 5 students based on marks.
        Identify students who are below 20 years old and have marks above 70.
         Visualization Tasks (Better Insights)

    
## Running the Analysis
The script processes the dataset to perform various analytical operations, providing insights into sales trends and variations over time.
